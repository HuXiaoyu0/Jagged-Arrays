# Jagged-Arrays
data structure, homework 3

In this assignment you will build a custom data structure named JaggedArray. A JaggedArray is a 1D array
of n bins, and each bin stores a collection of elements of templated type T. Building this data structure will
give you practice with pointers, dynamic array allocation and deallocation, and writing templated classes.
The implementation of this data structure will involve writing one new class. You are not allowed to use any
of the STL container classes in your implementation or use any additional classes or structs.

medium.txt is used to test this customed data stucture.
